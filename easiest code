Return the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in the given string,
except we'll accept any letter for the 'd', so "cope" and "cooe" count.


def count_code(str):
  count=0 #number of 'co' and 'e'
  for e in range(len(str)):
    #as e has to be value of less than actuall length so that we index in str[e+3] in line 12 will not be out of range
    if(e<=len(str)-4):
      #conditions to check character
      if(str[e]=='c' and str[e+1]=='o' and str[e+3]=='e'):
        # increase the count by one 
        count=count+1
  print(z)
